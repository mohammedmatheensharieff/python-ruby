Ruby - is a opps language just like python. Have its own interpreter to execute the code.
       - Easy to install
       - code are small and easy to maintain
       - rich in-built function 
       - can be used to make small nodes, like internet and intranet
       - scripting language 
       Principle - 
	         Encapsulation - 
			Binding data and method together.
		       	Example - 
			Before we start understanding Encapsulation, we have to understand what is data and and what is method.
		        data -  a value , which can be store in a variable for further use.
			method - an object, fucntion.
			Lets see how to store a value in a variable - 
		        a = 5 # a is a variable and 5 is given to a as a value wiht the help of '= 'which is an assignment operator 
		     	Lets see how to define a method -
				use a def keyword to define a method in ruby .
				Syntax :
				def method_name # method name can be in lowercase or using camelCase
				  logic
			        end # end is enclosure 
	   		
		        	
        	 Polymorphism
		   multiple forms just like + and *
		   1 + 1 => 2 # here + operator is working as additional operator
 		   "1" + "1"  => "11"  # here + operator is working as concatenational operator
                   "h" * 3 =>  "hhh"
                    1.+(1)
                    object.function(arg)		    
		 Inheritance
		   ruby does not support multiple inheritance
		   Lets see how to define a class 
		   class ClassName # class is a keyword and next to it is className which must start with upercase
			   OBJECT  # group of methods 
	           end  		    # end is enclosure


		   class Apple
	             def iPhone
	               puts "I love iPhoneX"
	             end
                     def iPod
		       puts "Good for music lover, easy to carry"	      
	             end		     
	           end
                  # Apple is a class which have two objects iPhone and iPod to access these objects first you have to create/initialize the class or create a constructor of class
		   m = Apple.new # here new method will help you to initialize the class 
                   m.iPhone
                   m.iPod		   
		 Abstraction 
		 

Assignment   - 
	 Find out the missing elements from the given input(take the input from command line)
	 Sample input - [2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18]
         Sample Output 10, 16
	 python3 file.py "[2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18]"
